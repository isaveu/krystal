It's C++11. It reads JSON. Why not.
In development.

Goals
-----

- primarily for myself to practice with variants, parsers, etc.
- clear and clean design and code base
- use C++11 standard library and language features
	- no reinventing of wheels wrt strings, maps, vectors, etc.
- no other dependencies for normal library use
	- will use my Inquisition library for tests
- initially
	- read-only data
